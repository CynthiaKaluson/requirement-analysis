# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is the process of identifying and documenting the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system. It is a critical part of the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**, as it helps set clear goals and guidelines for the project.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
- Prevents misunderstandings by defining clear requirements.
- Improves project timelines by focusing on what's essential.
- Aligns business goals with user needs, ensuring better user experience.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis
- **Requirement Gathering**: Collecting input from stakeholders.
- **Requirement Elicitation**: Uncovering hidden or implicit requirements.
- **Requirement Documentation**: Writing clear and detailed requirements.
- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling**: Analyzing needs and creating models.
- **Requirement Validation**: Ensuring the requirements meet stakeholders' needs.

## Types of Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- The system must allow users to book tickets.
- The system must send email confirmations for bookings.

### Non-functional Requirements
- The system must handle 100 concurrent users without performance degradation.
- The system must have a response time of less than 2 seconds for each action.

## Use Case Diagrams
A Use Case Diagram helps visualize how the system interacts with external actors such as users or other systems. These diagrams are useful for identifying key system functionalities.

## Acceptance Criteria
Acceptance Criteria are conditions that must be met for a system to be considered complete and functional. 

Example for **Checkout** feature:
- The system must allow users to add tickets to their cart.
- The system must allow users to proceed to checkout and confirm their booking.
